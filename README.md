# Movie Recommendation Systems

Recommendation systems are some of the most visible applications of Data Science. Their algorithms
learn about past preferences and recommend items that the user is most likely to purchase or use.
Almost every major tech company has applied them in some form. Facebook uses it to recommend
people to follow and pages to like, YouTube to decide which video to play next on autoplay and
Amazon uses it to suggest products to customers. In 2009, Netflix even offered a prize of a million
dollars to anyone who could improve its recommendation system by 10%.
There are 3 basic types of recommendation systems:
Simple recommendation systems: recommend the top items to all customers based on a certain
metric or score.
Contentâ€‘based recommendation systems: suggest similar items based on a past purchase. The
idea behind it is that if a person likes a particular item, they will also like an item that is similar to it.
Collaborative filtering engines: predict the rating that a user would give an item based on past
ratings and preferences of other similar users.
In this project, we will build 3 recommendation systems (one of each type) and discuss their uses and
limitations.
